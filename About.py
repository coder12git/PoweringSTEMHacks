Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to
reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Our application detects the following diseases:
* Actinic keratosis,
* Basal cell carcinoma,
* Dermatofibroma,
* Melanoma,
* Nevus,
* Pigmented benign keratosis,
* Seborrheic keratosis,
* Squamous cell carcinoma,
* Vascular lesion.
